Ref elements are\nsimple links, while Settings elements are links with additional\nvalues. If any of the required Image attributes or elements are\nmissing, its guaranteed to be an invalid document. The required\nattributes and elements are ID and Pixels. ExperimenterRef is\nrequired for all Images with well formed LSIDs. ImageType is a\nvendor-specific designation of the type of image this is. Examples\nof ImageType include 'STK', 'SoftWorx', etc. The Name attributes are\nin all cases the name of the element instance. In this case, the\nname of the image, not necessarily the filename. Physical size of\npixels are microns[µm].\n\n:ivar acquisition_date: The acquisition date of the Image. The\n    element contains an xsd:dateTime string based on the ISO 8601\n    format (i.e. 1988-04-07T18:39:09.359) YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:SS.sssZ Y\n    - Year M - Month D - Day H - Hour m - minutes S - Seconds s -\n    sub-seconds (optional) Z - Zone (optional) +HH:mm or -HH:mm or Z\n    for UTC Note: xsd:dataTime supports a very wide date range with\n    unlimited precision. The full date range and precision are not\n    typically supported by platform- and language-specific\n    libraries. Where the supported time precision is less than the\n    precision used by the xsd:dateTime timestamp there will be loss\n    of precision; this will typically occur via direct truncation or\n    (less commonly) rounding. The year value can be large and/or\n    negative. Any value covering the current or last century should\n    be correctly processed, but some systems cannot process earlier\n    dates. The sub-second value is defined as an unlimited number of\n    digits after the decimal point. In Java a minimum of millisecond\n    precision is guaranteed. In C++ microsecond precision is\n    guaranteed, with nanosecond precision being available on some\n    platforms. Time zones are supported, eg\n    '2013-10-24T11:52:33+01:00' for Paris, but in most cases it will\n    be converted to UTC when the timestamp is written.\n:ivar experimenter_ref:\n:ivar description: A description for the image.
